# node-libp2p

This is my first try to establish a starting point for a libp2p based node for mypai project.

mypai wants to establish a decentral p2p depin infrastructure for democratized access to
llm agents.

Howly words - mypai stands for My Personal AI.

Finding no easy working solution for kad and gossib with rust support, i try it on my own,
learning a lot of other projects on how to use libp2p.

Influenced heavily by subsquid project.
